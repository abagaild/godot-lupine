# Lupine Engine Implementation Plan

## Overview
Lupine Engine is a narrative-focused game development platform built on Godot, designed to prioritize the creation of narrative RPGs and visual novels with strategy and minigame elements. The engine provides pre-built templates and modular components to help developers quickly prototype and build unique games without getting bogged down in early technical work.

## Core Philosophy
