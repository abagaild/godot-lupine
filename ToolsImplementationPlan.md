# Lupine Engine - RPG Maker Style Editor Tools Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT FOCUS: Topdown RPG 4-Dir Template Completion**

**Status**: Implementing complete topdown RPG template with full RPG Maker-style editor integration

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of RPG Maker-style visual editor tools for the Lupine Engine. These tools will provide intuitive, UI-driven interfaces for creating and editing game content while maintaining full code compatibility and extensibility.

## Core Philosophy
